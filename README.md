# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python to extract insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)

## 🔍 Key EDA Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Handle missing values (Age, Embarked)
3. Generate summary statistics
4. Visualize:
   - Histograms
   - Boxplots
   - Correlation Matrix
   - Pairplot
5. Analyze trends and relationships between features

## 📈 Key Insights
- Survival rate was higher in 1st class passengers and females
- Age and Fare columns are right-skewed
- SibSp and Parch have low correlation with survival
- Fare has a wide range with outliers

## 🧪 Dataset Info
- Total entries: 891
- Features: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
